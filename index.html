<p class="bigger">Neat English [also called Waynwood English] is an accent made to be as clear and precise as possible, based somewhat on the transatlantic accent with some tweaks [mainly being that it is fully rhotic]. Here is its info:</p>
<p>The grapheme 'er' is always pronounced /əɹ/ (which I'll be typing as 'ɚ' after this point)</p>
<p>The grapheme 'r' is always pronounced /ɹ/</p>
<p>The grapheme 'l' is always pronounced /l/</p>
<p>/t/ is never softened to /d/, /ʔ/, or /ɾ/ (the same can be said about /d/ on the last two)</p>
<p>/ð/ is never softened to /d/ or /v/</p>
<p>/θ/ is never softened to /t/ or /f/</p>
<p>/ɛ/ is pronounced /ɛ~e/</p>
<p>/o/ (or /ɒ/) is always pronounced /o/</p>
<p>/əʊ/ (or /oʊ/) is always pronounced /əʊ/</p>
<p>There is no <i>Rosas - roses</i> merger, meaning 'Rosas' is /ɹəʊzəz/ and 'roses' is /ɹəʊzɪz/</p>
<p>There is no <i>Mary - marry - merry</i> merger, meaning 'Mary' is /mɛːɹi/, 'marry' is /mæɹi/, and 'merry' is /mɛɹi/</p>
<p>There is no <i>father - bother</i> merger, meaning 'father' is /fɑːðɚ/ and 'bother' is /boðɚ/</p>
<p>There is no <i>trap - bath</i> merger, meaning 'trap' is /træp/ and 'bath' is /bɑːθ/</p>
<p>There is no <i>wine - whine</i> merger, meaning 'wine' is /waɪn/ and 'whine' is /ʍaɪn/</p>
<p>There is no <i>mirror - nearer</i> merger, meaning 'mirror' is /mɪɹɚ/ and 'nearer' is /niːɹɚ/</p>
<p>And, as a personal preference, iron is pronounced /aɪɹɪn/</p>
